SantanderCodingTest

Hello,

The application is a standard ASP.NET Core 6 application. To download the source code, use the command: git clone https://github.com/ArkadiusAlone/SantanderCodingTest.git 
After that, open the SantanderCodingTest.sln project using software like Visual Studio 2022 and run it. 
The application is equipped with Swagger, making it easier to test its functionality.

If I had more time, I would focus on adding additional unit tests and integration tests. I believe the current implementation of mocking the HttpClient could be improved further. 
Other steps for enhancement would involve implementing caching, pagination if required, addressing performance optimizations, and expanding the scope of testing.

Arkadiusz Durakiewicz.
