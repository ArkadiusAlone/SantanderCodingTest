SantanderCodingTest

Arkadiusz Durakiewicz.

You should share a public repository with us, that should include a README.md file which describes how to run the application, any assumptions you have made, and
any enhancements or changes you would make, given the time :

Hello,

The application is the standard ASP.NET Core 6 application. 
Use to downaload the source : git clone https://adres-repozytorium.git
The using e.g Visual Studio 2022 open the SantanderCodingTest.sln project and run it. 
Application has the Swagger so it easier to test it. 

If I had more time I would add more unit test, integration tests.
The mocking of HttpClient is not fully good written I think. 
More steps would be caching, paggination if neeeded, more performance improvments and tests.
